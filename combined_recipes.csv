 | Lay 4 to 6 dumpling wrappers on a clean work surface. Brush the edges of the wrappers with water. For each dumpling, hold a wrapper in a slightly cupped hand. Use a dinner knife or teaspoon to scoop up about 1 1/2 teaspoons of filling (the amount depends on the wrapper size). Place the filling slightly off-center toward the upper half of the wrapper. Shape it into a flat mound and keep a knuckle's length (3/4 inch) of wrapper clear on all sides. Bring up the wrapper edge closest to you to close, then firmly press to seal well and create a half-moon. You can leave the dumplings like this, or, for a fancier look, form two small pleats near the center, pressing firmly to hold, or make a series of large pleats at the rim from one end to the other, firmly pressing into place.
 | Place the shaped dumpling on a prepared baking sheet. Repeat, spacing the dumplings 1/2 inch apart. Keep the finished ones covered with a dry kitchen towel to keep them from drying out.
 | Return the water to a gentle boil; add half of the dumplings, gently dropping each in; use a slotted spoon or spider to nudge them to prevent sticking. Let the dumplings cook until they float to the surface and are translucent (the filling is fuzzily visible) and the wrapper is chewy-tender, 6 to 8 minutes. If the water returns to a boil, reduce the heat (a hard boil can make dumplings burst open). Scoop out the cooked dumplings with a slotted spoon, letting excess water drip off. Arrange the dumplings on the prepared platter and cover with a large inverted bowl to keep warm.
 | Return the water to a gentle boil and repeat with the remaining dumplings. Drizzle the reserved sauce onto the dumplings; use two large spoons to gently toss. Sprinkle with cilantro, if desired, and serve immediately.

Butternut Squash Ravioli,"3 large eggs plus 2 large egg yolks, divided|3 tablespoons water, divided|5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided|1 cup all-purpose flour, plus more as needed|¾ cup white whole-wheat flour|¾ teaspoon kosher salt plus a pinch, divided|3 cups chopped butternut squash (1/2-inch pieces)|½ medium onion, cut into 1/2-inch wedges|3 large cloves garlic, peeled|¼ teaspoon ground pepper|¾ cup finely grated Parmesan cheese|3 tablespoons unsalted butter","Preheat oven to 400F.
 | Whisk 2 eggs, egg yolks, 2 tablespoons water and 1 tablespoon oil in a medium bowl. Add all-purpose flour, whole-wheat flour and 1/4 teaspoon salt to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. With the mixer on medium speed, add the egg mixture and knead until the dough is smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. (Add more all-purpose flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, if the dough is too sticky to come together into a ball.) Place the dough in an oiled bowl, cover and let rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes or up to 2 hours.
 | Meanwhile, combine butternut squash, onion, garlic, pepper, 2 tablespoons oil and 1/2 teaspoon salt on a rimmed baking sheet.

Place the sheet of pasta on a lightly floured work surface. Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough.
 | Whisk the remaining egg and 1 tablespoons water together in a small bowl. Determine approximately where the halfway point is lengthwise on a sheet of pasta. Brush one half of the dough with egg wash. Using about 2 teaspoons each, spoon mounds of the butternut squash filling onto the egg-washed side, leaving about 3/4 inch between the mounds. Fold the other half of the pasta sheet over to cover the filling. Seal the edges around each mound of filling and press out any excess air. Use a pastry cutter or knife to cut individual ravioli. Transfer the ravioli to the prepared baking sheets. Repeat with the remaining pasta sheets and filling.
 | Add half the ravioli to the boiling water and stir a few times to submerge and separate them. Cook at a gentle boil until just tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the ravioli to a serving bowl. Repeat with the remaining ravioli.
 | Heat butter and the remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Cook, swirling the pan to encourage even browning, until the mixture starts to turn brown and smell nutty, about 2 minutes. Season with the remaining pinch of salt. Pour the mixture over the butternut squash ravioli and gently toss to coat.

Almond Burfi,1 cup blanched almond flour (see Tip)|1 cup nonfat dry milk|¼ teaspoon ground cardamom|½ cup sugar|½ cup water|5 threads saffron|¼ cup finely chopped salted roasted pistachios,"Combine almond flour, dry milk and cardamom in a medium bowl. Set aside.
 | Combine sugar and water in a medium saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring with a wooden spoon, until the sugar is melted. Add saffron; bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally. (You'll see white bubbles appear.) Continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until the mixture reduces into a syrup, about 10 minutes. (You can tell it's ready when it coats the spoon and the excess drips off slowly.)
 | Reduce heat to low. Slowly fold in the flour mixture, using the wooden spoon. The dough will be crumbly at first but will come together as you continue to work it. (If needed, you can add 1 to 2 tablespoons water to make it more pliable, but be careful not to add more than that as it will make the end product too soft.) The dough will pull away from the sides of the pot and form a ball. Continue working the dough with the wooden spoon. It will be somewhat tough (not as soft as cookie dough, for example). Test the dough by pulling off a small piece with wet fingers and rolling it into a ball. If you can do that without the dough sticking to your fingers, it's ready. Remove the pot from the heat.
 | Here's the fun part: shaping your burfi! Spread the dough on a greased baking sheet and score it into a grid to make 24 1-inch squares. (Alternatively, using 1 teaspoon for each, shape the dough into about 30 balls. Or shape the dough into round discs, or use silicone molds to make your desired shapes.) Sprinkle pistachios on top (or roll the balls in pistachios), if desired.
 | Let the burfi cool at room temperature for at least 2 hours before serving or storing. (The burfi can be stored airtight at room temperature for up to 1 week--but good luck keeping them around that long.) Once cooled, the burfi should have some bite. (If it is soft and chewy, don't fret. You can just tell your guests that you've made peda, a different Indian dessert that's also served during festivals. Talk about no-fail!)

Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to a low simmer, cover and cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part registers 165°F, about 12 minutes. Transfer the meat to a clean cutting board to cool. Shred the meat.
 | Meanwhile, soak cornhusks in a large pot or bowl of hot water. Weigh the husks down so they stay submerged.
 | Chop the remaining onion wedge. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the chopped onion; cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent, 2 to 3 minutes. Add minced garlic; cook, stirring constantly, until aromatic, about 30 seconds. Add tomatoes and cook, stirring, until they soften into a thick, chunky paste, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in the shredded meat, chipotles, adobo sauce, oregano, pepper and 1/2 cup broth. Stir in 1/4 teaspoon salt and bring to a boil. Lower the heat, cover and cook for 5 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and set aside.
 | If using fresh masa, put it in a large bowl and add 1/2 cup broth. Knead with your hands until a wet dough forms. (If using masa harina, place it in a large bowl and add 2 1/4 cups broth. Mix until evenly moist and soft.)
 | Pour the remaining 1 1/4 cups oil into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Add the dough, 1 tablespoon at a time, to the oil while mixing on low speed and working up to medium speed once the dough comes together.
 | Add baking powder and the remaining 2 teaspoons salt. (If using masa harina, add an additional 1/2 to 3/4 cup broth if the dough seems stiff.) Mix on high speed for 10 minutes, scraping down the sides as needed, until the dough is smooth and fluffy.
 | To assemble tamales: Remove a husk from the water and pat dry. Choose the largest, thickest husks that don't have any holes. Peel off and discard any dried corn silk.
 | Use a rubber spatula to spread about 1/2 cup of dough (or less: the amount will depend on the size of your husk) in a rectangle on the husk, leaving about 3 inches of space on the narrower end of the husk, where you'll fold it closed, and 2 inches of space on the other end. Using a slotted spoon, add about 1 tablespoon of the reserved filling down the middle of the dough. Bring one end of the husk toward the other and press together lightly to seal the dough inside the husk. (If the filling spills out, you've added too much, but you can spoon a little more masa on top of any leaks.) Tuck the edges of the husk under each other to form a long tube. Hold the tube vertically and press firmly on the bottom edge of the tamale to seal. Fold the husk back in the place where you've sealed it. Place on a baking sheet and repeat to make the remaining tamales.
 | Add 1 inch of water to a large pot fitted with a steamer basket. Line the basket with a layer of husks. Bring the water to a light boil. Add the tamales carefully in a vertical position. Steam, adding more water if necessary, until the husk just starts to pull away from the dough, 35 to 40 minutes.
 | Using tongs, transfer the tamales to a baking sheet; let cool for 15 minutes. Serve the tamales with salsa, crema (or sour cream) and avocado, if desired.
