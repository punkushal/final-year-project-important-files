Vigorously stir and fold with a fork or spatula to make a cohesive, thick mixture with no visible large chunks of meat. Cover and let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. You should have about 2 cups of filling.
  Meanwhile, prepare sauce: Mince garlic, then mash with the flat side of a chef's knife (or use a garlic press). Place the garlic in a small bowl; stir in soy sauce, vinegar and 2 teaspoons chile oil. Taste and add heat with more chile oil, if desired.

  Lay 4 to 6 dumpling wrappers on a clean work surface. Brush the edges of the wrappers with water. For each dumpling, hold a wrapper in a slightly cupped hand. Use a dinner knife or teaspoon to scoop up about 1 1/2 teaspoons of filling (the amount depends on the wrapper size). Place the filling slightly off-center toward the upper half of the wrapper. Shape it into a flat mound and keep a knuckle's length (3/4 inch) of wrapper clear on all sides. Bring up the wrapper edge closest to you to close, then firmly press to seal well and create a half-moon. You can leave the dumplings like this, or, for a fancier look, form two small pleats near the center, pressing firmly to hold, or make a series of large pleats at the rim from one end to the other, firmly pressing into place.
  Place the shaped dumpling on a prepared baking sheet. Repeat, spacing the dumplings 1/2 inch apart. Keep the finished ones covered with a dry kitchen towel to keep them from drying out.
  Return the water to a gentle boil; add half of the dumplings, gently dropping each in; use a slotted spoon or spider to nudge them to prevent sticking. Let the dumplings cook until they float to the surface and are translucent (the filling is fuzzily visible) and the wrapper is chewy-tender, 6 to 8 minutes. If the water returns to a boil, reduce the heat (a hard boil can make dumplings burst open). Scoop out the cooked dumplings with a slotted spoon, letting excess water drip off. Arrange the dumplings on the prepared platter and cover with a large inverted bowl to keep warm.
  Return the water to a gentle boil and repeat with the remaining dumplings. Drizzle the reserved sauce onto the dumplings; use two large spoons to gently toss. Sprinkle with cilantro, if desired, and serve immediately.

Almond Burfi,1 cup blanched almond flour (see Tip)|1 cup nonfat dry milk|¼ teaspoon ground cardamom|½ cup sugar|½ cup water|5 threads saffron|¼ cup finely chopped salted roasted pistachios,"Combine almond flour, dry milk and cardamom in a medium bowl. Set aside.
  Combine sugar and water in a medium saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring with a wooden spoon, until the sugar is melted. Add saffron; bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally. (You'll see white bubbles appear.) Continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until the mixture reduces into a syrup, about 10 minutes. (You can tell it's ready when it coats the spoon and the excess drips off slowly.)
  Reduce heat to low. Slowly fold in the flour mixture, using the wooden spoon. The dough will be crumbly at first but will come together as you continue to work it. (If needed, you can add 1 to 2 tablespoons water to make it more pliable, but be careful not to add more than that as it will make the end product too soft.) The dough will pull away from the sides of the pot and form a ball. Continue working the dough with the wooden spoon. It will be somewhat tough (not as soft as cookie dough, for example). Test the dough by pulling off a small piece with wet fingers and rolling it into a ball. If you can do that without the dough sticking to your fingers, it's ready. Remove the pot from the heat.
  Here's the fun part: shaping your burfi! Spread the dough on a greased baking sheet and score it into a grid to make 24 1-inch squares. (Alternatively, using 1 teaspoon for each, shape the dough into about 30 balls. Or shape the dough into round discs, or use silicone molds to make your desired shapes.) Sprinkle pistachios on top (or roll the balls in pistachios), if desired.
  Let the burfi cool at room temperature for at least 2 hours before serving or storing. (The burfi can be stored airtight at room temperature for up to 1 week--but good luck keeping them around that long.) Once cooled, the burfi should have some bite. (If it is soft and chewy, don't fret. You can just tell your guests that you've made peda, a different Indian dessert that's also served during festivals. Talk about no-fail!)

Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to a low simmer, cover and cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part registers 165°F, about 12 minutes. Transfer the meat to a clean cutting board to cool. Shred the meat.
  Meanwhile, soak cornhusks in a large pot or bowl of hot water. Weigh the husks down so they stay submerged.
  Chop the remaining onion wedge. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the chopped onion; cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent, 2 to 3 minutes. Add minced garlic; cook, stirring constantly, until aromatic, about 30 seconds. Add tomatoes and cook, stirring, until they soften into a thick, chunky paste, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in the shredded meat, chipotles, adobo sauce, oregano, pepper and 1/2 cup broth. Stir in 1/4 teaspoon salt and bring to a boil. Lower the heat, cover and cook for 5 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and set aside.
  If using fresh masa, put it in a large bowl and add 1/2 cup broth. Knead with your hands until a wet dough forms. (If using masa harina, place it in a large bowl and add 2 1/4 cups broth. Mix until evenly moist and soft.)
  Pour the remaining 1 1/4 cups oil into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Add the dough, 1 tablespoon at a time, to the oil while mixing on low speed and working up to medium speed once the dough comes together.
  Add baking powder and the remaining 2 teaspoons salt. (If using masa harina, add an additional 1/2 to 3/4 cup broth if the dough seems stiff.) Mix on high speed for 10 minutes, scraping down the sides as needed, until the dough is smooth and fluffy.
  To assemble tamales: Remove a husk from the water and pat dry. Choose the largest, thickest husks that don't have any holes. Peel off and discard any dried corn silk.
  Use a rubber spatula to spread about 1/2 cup of dough (or less: the amount will depend on the size of your husk) in a rectangle on the husk, leaving about 3 inches of space on the narrower end of the husk, where you'll fold it closed, and 2 inches of space on the other end. Using a slotted spoon, add about 1 tablespoon of the reserved filling down the middle of the dough. Bring one end of the husk toward the other and press together lightly to seal the dough inside the husk. (If the filling spills out, you've added too much, but you can spoon a little more masa on top of any leaks.) Tuck the edges of the husk under each other to form a long tube. Hold the tube vertically and press firmly on the bottom edge of the tamale to seal. Fold the husk back in the place where you've sealed it. Place on a baking sheet and repeat to make the remaining tamales.
  Add 1 inch of water to a large pot fitted with a steamer basket. Line the basket with a layer of husks. Bring the water to a light boil. Add the tamales carefully in a vertical position. Steam, adding more water if necessary, until the husk just starts to pull away from the dough, 35 to 40 minutes.
  Using tongs, transfer the tamales to a baking sheet; let cool for 15 minutes. Serve the tamales with salsa, crema (or sour cream) and avocado, if desired.

  Position a rack in lower third of oven; preheat to 425 degrees F.
  Scrape the apple filling into the prepared crust. If using cutouts, trim the excess dough so it's flush with the pan. Brush the edge of the dough with some milk. Arrange the cutouts over the filling, working from the outer edge inward and overlapping slightly. Leave a little hole in the center to allow for venting. Lightly brush the cutouts with the remaining milk and sprinkle with sanding (or turbinado) sugar. (Alternatively, remove the top sheet of paper from the top crust and invert onto the filling. Remove the paper. Tuck the edge of the top crust under the edge of the bottom crust, sealing the two. Crimp or flute the edge. Cut several slits in the top, brush with the remaining milk and sprinkle sanding or turbinado sugar over it.)
  Bake the pie for 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees F. Cover the edges of the crust with foil. Continue baking until the top crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling, 45 to 50 minutes more. Cool on a wire rack for at least 1 hour before slicing.

3/4 cup brown sugar, lightly packed
1/4 cup pure maple syrup
For the filling
4 tablespoons vegan butter, softened to room temperature
1/2 cup brown sugar, packed
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon","Microwave the soy milk for about 1 minute and 30 seconds, until warm but not too hot or it will kill the yeast.
In a large bowl, add the warm soy milk, sugar and yeast. Stir a little bit; the yeast will get foamy.
To the yeast mixture, add the melted vegan butter, salt and 4 1/2 cups of flour. Stir with a large spoon until it comes together. Add additional flour, as needed. Alternatively, use a stand mixer with a dough hook and mix on low until the mixture pulls away from the sides of the bowl. It should still be soft and slightly sticky.
If using a stand mixer, simply mix with the dough hook until you have a smooth ball of dough. If not, turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead for 3-4 minutes until you have a smooth ball of dough.
Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a towel and let it rise in a warm place for 20 minutes. Here's what I do: Turn the oven to 170 degrees F. Once heated, turn it off, place the covered bowl inside the oven, and leave the oven door cracked.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (skip this for make ahead option) and grease a 9×13 inch baking dish.
Make the topping
Spread the chopped pecans in the bottom of the greased pan.
Combine the rest of the topping ingredients (vegan butter, brown sugar and maple syrup) in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir until the butter has melted. Simmer for a few minutes, stirring frequently.
Remove from heat and pour it over the pecans in the dish.
Assemble and bake
Sprinkle a clean counter or pastry mat with flour. Punch the dough down and use a rollin pin to roll the dough into a large rectangle, about 1/2 inch thick. Sprinkle with more flour to prevent sticking to the rolling pin.
Spread the softened vegan butter over the dough, then sprinkle with brown sugar and cinnamon.
Starting with the long edge closest to you, roll the dough into a tight log.Using a serrated knife (or plain floss!) cut off the two ends. Slice the rest into 12 rolls.
Place the rolls on top of the pecan mixture in the baking dish. Make ahead: Cover with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator overnight. Or follow the next step to bake immediately.
If you have refrigerated the rolls overnight, let them sit at room temperature for about an hour before baking. Bake for 30-35 minutes, until golden brown and the centers are cooked through.
Remove the baking dish from the oven and immediately invert (very carefully!) onto a serving tray or other large baking dish.
